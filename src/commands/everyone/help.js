To gain XP on Amica, she would use `/set 2`. To switch to Lumina, she would do `/set 1`. This is a **vital** step if you wish to have multiple characters on one Discord account. Staff will monitor to ensure everyone is doing this properly so that XP is awarded to the correct characters.\n" +

					'1. Use /approve_player to select a player and approve a character. Staff must set the playerâ€™s name for them initially, but they can change it after the fact.\n' +
					'2. Use /award_xp to change the XP of any player. If awarding a character xp and levels that would put them into a different tier, staff must remind the player to use the /set command afterwards so that tier roles update automatically\n' +
					'3. Use /xp to check the XP for any player\n' +
					'4. Use /edit_channel to set xp per post baselines for each channel (this would ideally be the same for each channel except for say, solo bubbles)\n' +
					'5. Use /edit_config to change the xp per post divisor used for the exponential calculation, the xp per post formula (we will keep this on exponential to reward longposting), as well as role modifiers'
